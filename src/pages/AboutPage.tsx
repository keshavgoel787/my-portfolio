          <Typography paragraph>
            Iâ€™m Keshav, a Data Science and Math Major at Northeastern. Iâ€™m passionate about applying data and machine learning to bridge gaps and make global impacts. I aim to apply my skills at the intersection of Data and various fields such as Health Care, Business, Entertainment, and Biology, with a focus on Computer Visions, NLP, and much more! When Iâ€™m not busy coding, you can find me at Bhangra practice, out hiking, or simply in my room listening to latest big music album. If you share these interests or have any questions, feel free to just say hi or reach out for a chat (I love to yap)!
